        Shahi Tukda Recipe
    </h1>
<h2>
    This is a very famous Hyderabadi dish and is a very simple, but rich dessert. It is great for a large dinner party as the recipe can be easily multiplied to make more. It is best eaten chilled. If available, you can add a few drops of Kewra essence to the milk mixture once it has cooled.

<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
    <li>8 slices white bread, crusts removed and cut into 4 squares</li>
    <li>¼ cup cashews</li>
    <li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons pistachio nuts</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</Li>
    <li>5 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
</ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the bread slices in the hot oil until deep, golden brown; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Fry the cashews, almonds, and pistachio nuts in the hot oil until golden brown; remove from oil and set aside to cool. Chop roughly.</li>
<li>Bring the milk to a gentle boil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat; continue boiling until the volume of milk reduces by about half. Pour the evaporated milk into the pan and add the sugar, cardamom, and saffron; simmer together 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.</li> 
<li>Arrange the fried bread pieces in a shallow dish large enough to allow them to be laid in a single layer. Evenly pour the milk mixture over the bread. Scatter the chopped nuts over the bread. Chill in refrigerator until completely cold, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
